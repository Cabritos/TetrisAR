This is a very simple and rough demo of what a 3D AR tetris could be. It was made with Unity and EasyAR.

I played with the idea of having to deal with the game space itself like the tetraminos pile was some kind of jenga tower. Having to manipulate objects like this as a player proved to be harder than it looks (it doesn't help I didn't make a friendlier input that adapts to one's position if you move around the game).

I got to a point where a basic gameplay was possibe, but abandon it because my cellphone couldn't run it very well :(
